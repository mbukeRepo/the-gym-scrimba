# Notes app

In this simple react project I implemented a notes app with a markdown editor that saves notes in local storage. These are some crucial packages I used in the app.

| package                                                                          | description                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| react-mde                                                                        | A simple yet powerful and extensible React Markdown Editor                         that aims to have feature parity with the Github Markdown editor.               |
| react-showdown                                                                   | This give us access to converter object which react-mde use to generate preview. |
| react-split                                                                      | providing  <Split />                                                               component wraps multiple children components to create a resizeable split view. |
| nanoid                                                                           | A tiny, secure, URL-friendly, unique string ID generator for JavaScript.         |

In this app we have three main components that holds all the functionality.

**Editor**: A wrapper around react-mde Editor component using react-showdown to convert markdown to HTML for preview.

- Props: currentNote, updateNote.
- State: selectedTab (”write” | “preview”)

**Sidebar:** This is a crucial part of our application, because it handles the creation, and deletion, and handles navigation between different notes.

The main state in our app:

notes: Note[]

currentNoteId: String

        Note ⇒ {id: String, body: String}

     The main methods in our app:

| Method     | Description                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| updateNote | That updates the body of the currentId                                                                      |
| createNote | Creates a new note with a new id generated by nanoid and set currentid to the id of the newly created note. |
| deleteNote | Filters out the selected id.                                                                                |

The last thing I want to point out is that our app syncs the notes in the local storage every time our **notes** state changes.
