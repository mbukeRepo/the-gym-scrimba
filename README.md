## Scrimba Projects

This repository contains projects I did during scrimba react basics
course.

These are the core concepts that were covered.

- React components
- Props vs States
- Lifecycle methods
- JSX
- Rendering arrays
- Consuming API in react
- Forms input
- useEffect

The core projects that were implemented are:
